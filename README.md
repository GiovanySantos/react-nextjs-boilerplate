[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) boilerplate

## Structure

This is a basic structure to start developing a nextjs project with typescript, css modules or tailwindcss(better), prettier configuration and standard to good practices eslint rules

First, install the node_modules dependencies:

Open your terminal on VSCode (Ctrl + J and click on terminal on the bottom)

- Type:

```bash
yarn install
```

- Once finished, run

```bash
yarn lint
```

Now you can run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

If you want to build to send to a production server run

```bash
yarn dev
```

The build will be on the .next folder
